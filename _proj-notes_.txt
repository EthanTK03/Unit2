        displaying each replayas "game1", "game4", and so on as buttons. click one and watch the replay, 
        afterwards it goes back to the replay menu)


The project:
    1. Be able to play through the entirety of hangman game, replay it, etc
    2. Create a pop-up window to play the game, a text box allowing you to enter any letter
        - Allow specialized error message if an unrecognized character or string of charactrs
        is entered, keep the game running without consequences
    3. Display a word blanked out for each character ('_ _ _'), fill it out for each correct guess
    4. After each incorrect guess, draw a part of the hanging man
        - First a circle for the head. then a line for the body, then each individual limb.
        - Have the hanging stand drawn before the game begins
    5. When game is finished, ask user to play again, watch replay, or end the session.

    Record all events that occur in the game, allow a "replay" program to go through 
    everything that happened with a set amiunt of time between each event. 
        - Make a pause/play button for during the replay

From last Wednesday: 
# Think about your current project, and a collection of things. 
# Use the example above(dic2.py) as a starting point, and put your items in a dictionary 
# (you'll need to decide on a unique key). 
# Using the example code, let the user type in the id so they can get the data.
